Let me paint you a tale of my love for wordle. It was 2021 and we were a SOLID year and some change into the pandemic. Most of use were confined at home to be good people for our friends and family but the boredom was immense. Then like a shining beacon of mental hope came wordle, the (relatively) simple game of guessing a word and trying to guess the secret word based on the hints given from that first guess. What a dream, something for your mind to grab on to while the world continued its insanity. Thus, my love for wordle was born.

Pseudocode:
	
	1. Define variables used to track the state of the game and import the words from a JS file
	
	2. Store cached element references
	
	3. Loading the game should automatically select the word for the current game session, render the game, and player should immediately be able to start guessing words.
	
	4. Define required constants, i.g. wordOfDay, attemptCounter
	
	5. Handle player clicking letters and/or typing on the keyboard ðŸ˜³
	
	6. Check if word player submitted is actually a word AND if the player entered actual letters ðŸ˜³
	
	7. Change the color of the display tiles and keyboard depending on whether the letters are in the word
	
	8. Keep a counter for attempts and state whether the player failed or the attempts it took to get the right answer
	
	9. Create light/dark mode functionality
	
	10. ???
	
	11. Profit?
	
  	12. Create Reset functionality!

Next Steps:
1. light and dark mode
